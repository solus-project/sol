sol
----

Replacement for `eopkg`, the Solus package manager (a fork of eopkg).

This is not an effort to create "yet another package manager", it is instead
a current research effort for the successor to `eopkg`, to create a modern
package manager to deal with the needs of today, and of Solus itself.

 - Spend less time downloading
 - Spend less time applying updates
 - Don't ever break. (ABI, layout, config, etc.)

The Solus mantra is "Install today, update forever". We need a modern software
and update management system to handle this in the most efficient manner for
the user, to truly handle the needs of a modern rolling release designed for
the ordinary user.

More details will be fleshed out as and when we've settled on them. In the
mean time, don't panic. :]

`sol` is a [Solus project](https://getsol.us/)
